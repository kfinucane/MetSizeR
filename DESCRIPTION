Description: Provides a Shiny application to estimate sample size required for
    a specified metabolomic experiment to achieve a desired statistical power.
    Estimation is possible with or without available data from a pilot study. 
    Required sample size can be estimated for studies which aim to use 
    Probablistic Principal Components Analysis or Probablistic Principal 
    Component and Covariate Analysis as analysis methods.
